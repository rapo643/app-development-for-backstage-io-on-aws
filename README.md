# OPA (Orchestrate Platform and Applications) on AWS

OPA Provides a new developer experience to simplify the use and consumption of AWS services while minimizing required expertise in cloud infrastructure technologies.  
Built on the [Backstage open platform](https://backstage.io), this solution makes the AWS cloud more accessible to application developers allowing them to focus on building application logic and delivering business value.

This solution leverages the flexibility and extensibility of the Backstage platform to provide customizable software templates, scaffolder actions, and deployment patterns. While this provides a lot of freedom in implementation, it can be overwhelming to get started.  To help users get started, a reference repository is also provided with samples to show how to use the solution.
